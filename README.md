# Chess Game Engine in Python (Enemy AI Coming Soon)

I created this specifically with the intention of making an enemy AI make moves using alpha-beta pruning on minimax trees. It seemed like a fun idea to make the game engine as well, but it has proven to be quite the task. However, the game works very well at the moment, it just does not consider en passant yet but that is next on the chopping block. For now the game works well to play against yourself or another person. 

In the future, a menu could be added for PvP options, or the board could visually flip for black's turn, but the goal at the moment is to experiment with the heuristics of a chess AI and see how good it can be at playing a measly 800 elo like me!
